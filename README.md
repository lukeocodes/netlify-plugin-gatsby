# Essential Gatsby Plugin - v2

The Essential Gatsby build plugin enables caching of builds, and adds supports
for SSR and DSG
[render modes](https://v4.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/rendering-options/) and
Gatsby Functions. It is installed automatically for all new Gatsby sites.

> **Note:**
>
> - Essential Gatsby includes functionality from the
>   [Gatsby Cache build plugin](https://github.com/jlengstorf/netlify-plugin-gatsby-cache).
>   If you already have the Gatsby Cache plugin installed on your Netlify site,
>   you should
>   [remove it](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#remove-a-plugin)
>   before installing this plugin.
> - Essential Gatsby is not compatible with the Gatsby community plugin
>   [gatsby-plugin-netlify-cache](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-netlify-cache/).

## Installation

Gatsby sites need two plugins to support all features.

1. The Netlify build plugin, called "Essential Gatsby" or
   `@netlify/plugin-gatsby`. This is installed automatically for all Gatsby
   sites deployed to Netlify.
2. The Gatsby plugin `gatsby-plugin-netlify`, which needs to be manually
   installed.

### Installing the Netlify build plugin

New Gatsby sites will have the Essential Gatsby build plugin installed
automatically. You can confirm this in the build logs. If you need to install it
manually, you have two options:

1. Search for "Essential Gatsby" and install the plugin
   [from the Netlify UI](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#ui-installation)

2. Install the plugin as `@netlify/plugin-gatsby` using
   [file-based plugin installation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/build-plugins/#file-based-installation).

### Install the Gatsby Plugin

You should also install the Gatsby plugin
[gatsby-plugin-netlify](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/gatsby-plugin-netlify/).
This is required for SSR pages, and adds support for Gatsby redirects and asset
caching rules:

1. Add the package as a dependency:

```shell
npm install -D gatsby-plugin-netlify
```

2. Then add the following to your `gatsby-config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-netlify'],
}
```

See
[the gatsby-plugin-netlify docs](https://github.com/netlify/gatsby-plugin-netlify/)
for more information, including optional plugin configuration.

### Caveats

Currently you cannot use `StaticImage` or `gatsby-transformer-sharp` in SSR or
DSG pages. The best workaround is to use an image CDN such as
[Cloudinary](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/using-cloudinary-image-service/)
or [imgix](https://github.com/imgix/gatsby) to host your images. This will give
you faster builds and rendering too.

### Local development

When developing Gatsby Functions it is usually easier to use the built-in
`gatsby develop` functions server. However if you want to try the Netlify
functions wrapper it will run via `netlify dev`. You should be sure to run
`netlify build` first, so that the wrappers are generated and the functions
copied across.
